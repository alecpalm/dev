                   OVERVIEW OF CRIMINAL LAW




Why study criminal
law?

   Criminal law is the foundation of
   the criminal justice system. It
   defines the conduct that may
   lead to arrest by police, trial
   before the courts, and
   incarceration in prison.
WHAT IS CRIMINAL LAW?




WHAT IS A CRIME?


   A crime is a moral wrong that results
   in some social harm.




  However …
                           Not every moral
                           wrong is a crime
 And some maybe shouldn’t be on the books …




SOURCES OF
CRIMINAL LAW

  1. Common Law
  2. Model Penal Code (MPC)
  3. Statute
  4. Case Law




 1. Common Law



   Crimes and defense were first defined by judges
   using general principle and customs, and rules
   were interpreted in light of the facts of the case
 2. Model Penal Code (MCP)


    Designed to stimulate and assist U.S. State Legislatures to
    update and standardize the penal law of the United States.

    The MPC was a project of the American Law Institute (ALI), and
    was published in 1962 after a ten-year drafting period

    The MPC itself is not legally-binding law, but since its publication
    in 1962 more than half of all U.S. states have enacted criminal
    codes that borrow heavily from it




 3. Statute



    Laws passed by legislature and signed by the
    executive. Courts are bound to apply the law that
    the legislature wrote as written unless it violates
    the U.S. Constitution




Federal v. State Laws
 Supremacy
 Clause
 This Constitution, and the
 Laws of the United States
 which shall be made in
 Pursuance thereof … shall be
 the supreme Law of the
 Land; and the Judges in
 every State shall be bound
 thereby, any Thing in the
 Constitution or Laws of any
 State to the Contrary
 notwithstanding. (Art. IV)




 Dual Sovereignty v. Double Jeopardy
The Double Jeopardy Clause
provides that no person may be
“twice put in jeopardy” “for the
same offence.”

Per the “dual-sovereignty” doctrine,
the Supreme Court has long held
that a “crime under one sovereign’s
laws is not ‘the same offence’ as a
crime under the laws of another
sovereign.” (Gamble v. United States)




Petite Policy



       A policy of the US Justice Department that following a state
       prosecution there should be no federal prosecution for the same
       transaction in the absence of compelling federal interests.

The Crime




Questions to Consider

   1. If the defendants’ beliefs were reasonable under the
   circumstances, do they merit conviction at all?
   2. What if the defendants were wrong about the teenager’s
   imminent death; can you be reasonable but wrong?
   3. What if their beliefs were sincere but not reasonable? Does
   that change whether they should be convicted of murder?
   4. Does Parker bear any responsibility for his acts leading to his
   death?

   What would a prosecutor argue? Defense counsel?




Your Verdict


    1. Is Dudley guilty of murder or any other crimes?
    2. Is Dudley guilty of murder or any other crimes?
    3. Is Brooks guilty of murder or any other crimes?
    4. Is boat owner John Want guilty of any crimes?
WHAT PUNISHMENT SHOULD THEY RECEIVE?


      If guilty, what punishment should they receive?
      Why?
      What would it accomplish?




The true verdict …
                        “We cannot allow
                   compassion for the criminal
                    to change or weaken the
                   legal definition of a crime.”


                English court found them guilty of
                 murder, and sentenced them to
                 death. Soon after the verdict, the
                 Queen commuted the sentence
                 to 6 months imprisonment.

         CRIME TRENDS
    ●   Overall violent crime volume decreased 1.0% for the nation
        from 1,326,600 in 2020 to 1,313,200 in 2021, which was up
        5.6% from 2019.
    ●   The number of murders increased from 22,000 in 2020 to
        22,900 in 2021. This constitutes an increase of 4.3% on top of
        the 29.4% increase in 2020.
    ●   From 2020 to 2021, the robbery rate decreased 8.9%, which
        heavily contributed to the decrease in overall violent crime
        despite increases in murder and rape rates at the national
        level.
    ●   The national property crime rate decreased by 4.5%,
        influenced by drops in burglary/breaking & entering, and
        larceny/theft.
    ●   The volume of drug-related offenses increased compared to
        2020 in every category except for marijuana/hashish.
    ●   Drug offenses involving stimulants had the largest increase
        from 2020 to 2021 at 17.8%.
    ●   The volume of violent crime victimizations of persons 65
        years of age or older increased by 8.9% from 2020 to 2021.

7




    Retribution


        Retribution imposes punishment based on just deserts. Offenders should
        receive the punishment that they deserve based on the seriousness of their
        criminal acts.




8




    Deterrence


       Specific deterrence imposes punishment to deter or discourage a defendant
       from committing a crime in the future.

       General deterrence punishes an offender as an example to deter others from
       violating the law.




9
     Rehabilitation



      The original goal of punishment in the United States was to reform offenders and to
      transform them into law-abiding and productive members of society.




10




     Incapacitation


        The aim of incapacitation is to remove offenders from society to prevent them
        from continuing to menace others.

        Selective incapacitation singles out offenders who have committed designated
        offenses for lengthy incarceration.




11




     Restoration


      Restoration stresses the harm caused to victims of crime and requires
      offenders to engage in financial restitution and community service to
      compensate the victims and the community and to “make them whole once
      again.”

     Utilitarianism v. Retributivism

      Utilitarianism is forward-looking and tries to deter future bad conduct while increasing
      happiness and reducing pain.
      (1) General deterrence;
      (2) Specific deterrence;
      (3) Rehabilitation;

      Retributivism views the punishment of a wrongdoer is justified because it is a deserved
      response to the wrongdoing
      (1) retribution;
      (2) Protective (Incapacitation);
      (3) Victim vindication (victim retribution and restoration)

16




         Focus on the Death Penalty
         (Capital Punishment)
          Death is a uniquely irreversible punishment. Despite the
          flaws in the death penalty process claimed by its many
          critics, capital offenders still often get far more process
          than the typical criminal offender. Actually executing
          someone requires unusually time-consuming and
          expensive procedures. Moreover, the jurisprudence on
          death sentencing is complex and voluminous.


17




    THE HISTORY OF THE
    DEATH PENALTY
•    In the colonies, people could be executed for many offenses
     including adultery, idolatry, witchcraft, and blasphemy
     prisoners were usually executed by hanging until the late
     1800s, when the electric chair was invented. The gas
     chamber followed in the 1920s,19 and lethal injection,
     now the mechanism of choice in most states,20 in the
     1970s

     Since colonial times, there have been sporadic efforts to
     abolish the death penalty in the United States, and many
     individual states have repealed capital statutes. Many
     European countries abandoned capital punishment after
     World War II but abolition has never taken hold on a
     national scale here as it did in Europe.

     The United States is now the only Western industrialized
     country that retains the death penalty


18
 Cont.

      •     There was a brief period of de facto abolition,
            and a still briefer period of de jure abolition. The
            number of executions plummeted from a high of
            199 in 1935 to zero in the five years between
            1967 and 1972. There were many reasons for
            the drop in executions. Habeas corpus petitions
            for state prisoners, rare before World War 1, had
            become more common as the federal courts
            became more concerned with the federal rights
            of state criminal defendants.

     8th Amendment – Cruel
     and Unusual Punishment




20




     The Death Penalty and the 8th
     Amendment’s Proportionality Test
          The Court has also considered whether, based on the nature of the underlying offense (or,
          as explored in the next topic, the capacity of the defendant), the imposition of capital
          punishment may be inappropriate in particular cases.

          “[T]he Eighth Amendment’s protection against excessive or cruel and unusual punishments
          flows from the basic ‘precept of justice that punishment for [a] crime should be graduated
          and proportioned to [the] offense.’

          Whether this requirement has been fulfilled is determined not by the standards that prevailed
          when the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791 but by the norms that ‘currently prevail.’
          The Amendment ‘draw[s] its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the
          progress of a maturing society.’”




21
     Application



         1) Limits the methods employed to inflict punishment
         2) Restricts the amount of punishment that may be
            imposed
         3) Prohibits the criminal punishment of certain acts




22




     The Constitutionality of the Death
     Penalty – Furman v. Georgia (1972)
         The "essential predicate" is "that a punishment must not by its severity be
         degrading to human dignity", especially torture.

         "A severe punishment that is obviously inflicted in wholly arbitrary fashion."
         (Furman v. Georgia temporarily suspended capital punishment for this
         reason.)

         "A severe punishment that is clearly and totally rejected throughout society.”

         "A severe punishment that is patently unnecessary."




23




     Justice Brennan Concurrence


     There are several principles that guide courts in determining whether a particular punishment is cruel
     and unusual.

     First, the punishment cannot be so severe that it degrades human dignity. This encompasses more
     than merely the pain or physical suffering inflicted by the punishment; it refers to punishment so
     barbaric that the recipient is treated as nonhuman. Second, the punishment cannot be inflicted
     arbitrarily. Third, the punishment must not be unacceptable to modern society. Finally, the punishment
     cannot be excessive. A punishment is excessive, or unnecessary, if another less severe punishment
     would be able to achieve the same punitive purpose.

     Applying these principles, the death penalty is a cruel and unusual punishment. It is unusually severe
     and degrading to human dignity, it is applied arbitrarily, it is viewed with significant doubt in
     contemporary society, and the less severe punishment of imprisonment would achieve the same
     punitive goals.



24
     The Death Penalty Reinstated –
     Gregg v. Georgia (1976)
      The punishment of death did not invariably violate the United States Constitution; that the
      death penalty was not a form of punishment that could never be imposed, regardless of the
      circumstances of the offense, regardless of the character of the offender, and regardless of
      the procedure followed in reaching the decision to impose it; and that the concerns that the
      penalty of death not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner were met by a carefully
      drafted statute that ensured that the sentencing authority was given adequate information
      and guidance. With regard to the Georgia statute, the Court held that the statutory system
      under which defendant was sentenced, which focused the jury's attention on the
      particularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the individual
      defendant and provided a method for review, did not violate the Constitution.




25




     When can it be applied? Coker v.
     Georgia

          A punishment is deemed excessive if:

          (1) it does not further any goal of sentencing, or

          (2) it is grossly disproportionate to the crime committed.




26




     Death Penalty Inappropriate in
     Certain Cases
     •   Imposing the death penalty for the crime of rape violates the Eighth
         Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment (Coker v. Georgia)
     •   Prohibiting imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child in cases where
         the victim did not die and death was not intended (Kennedy v. Lousiana)
     •   Capital punishment of an intellectually disabled individual constitutes cruel
         and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S.
         Constitution.(Atkins v. Virginia)

     How can it be applied? Baze v.
     Reese

                        Executions violate the Eighth Amendment
                       when they involve a method of execution in
                       which there is an objectively intolerable risk
                       of harm that is cruel and unusual.




31




     The Death Penalty as Implemented
     under the 8th Amendment
      •   the Court upheld the constitutionality of firing squads noting only punishments involving
          "unnecessary cruelty" violated the Eighth Amendment.
      •   The Court allowed electrocution as a more humane method of execution.
      •   The Court upheld a second attempt to execute a prisoner after the first attempted
          electrocution failed due to a mechanical malfunction concluding that a mere accident did not
          violate the Eighth Amendment because there was no "purpose to inflict unnecessary pain nor
          any unnecessary pain involved.
      •   The Court upheld lethal injection as there was not an objectively intolerable risk of harm that
          is cruel and unusual or any suggested alternative procedures must be feasible, readily
          implemented, and must significantly reduce a substantial risk of pain.. (Baze v. Reese) 552

        The Closing Arguments at Sentencing

     -- "unspeakable, horrific brutality and the unrelentless cruelty" carried out on Feb. 14, 2018.
     -- "It's been said that what one writes, and what one says, is a window to someone's soul," Satz said in his closing
     argument. "Some of the remarks the defendant wrote on his YouTube were: 'No mercy, no questions, double tap. I'm going
     to...murder children...I'd love to see the families suffer.’”
     -- Cruz researched previous mass shootings, Satz said, and planned a "systematic massacre."
     -- Cruz's phone revealed a video filmed three days before the carnage, in which Cruz said: "I'm going to be the next school
     shooter…my goal is to kill at least 20 people."
     -- two of the four gunshot wounds to 14-year-old victim Gina Montalto were contact wounds, meaning the end of Cruz's AR-
     15-style rifle "was right up against her chest and right up on her abdomen."
     -- Cruz fired 70 shots on Building 12's first floor
     -- Cruz fired just six shots on the second floor, because he couldn't find any targets, Satz said.
     -- Cruz fired 61 rounds on the third floor including into the back of geography teacher Scott Beigel trying to shepherd
     students to safety into his classroom.
     -- While Wang was lying on the ground injured, Cruz shot 15-year-old Peter Wang in the head four times
      -- doctor testimony proved Cruz doesn't have a mental disease, but an antisocial personality. Cruz's adoptive mother took
     him to multiple doctors
     -- Cruz "knew the difference between right and wrong that day -- and he chose wrong," she said.




35




        The Closing Arguments at Sentencing

     -- Defense argued Cruz suffered lifelong developmental delays that traced back to fetal alcohol
     spectrum disorders
     -- Cruz's birth mother was a drug and alcohol addict who drank and used drugs up until six weeks
     before Cruz was born, McNeill said in her opening argument. Cruz was "poisoned in the womb" and his
     "brain was irretrievably broken"
     -- he Broward County School Board classified Cruz as "developmentally delayed in all areas" and said
     he had "a language impairment" and the district classified him as an "ESE" student, or a special needs
     child
     -- "It's easier to call someone antisocial…than to accept what Nikolas Cruz really is: a broken, brain-
     damaged, mentally ill young man. Do we kill brain-damaged, mentally ill, broken people?"
     "Sentencing Nikolas to death will change absolutely nothing. It will not bring back those 17 innocent
     victims that he viciously murdered."

        The Verdict

     “The monster that killed them gets to live another day,” said Tony Montalto, whose daughter, Gina, was
     among the 17 people murdered in a Florida high school.

     “I think what is most upsetting to me is that the jury showed the killer more mercy than they showed the
     parents and families,” Tom Hoyer said

     Gena Hoyer, said a death sentence “might have prevented a future school shooter. Now they can look at
     this case and say, I might only get life.”

     “This jury failed our families today,” said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was killed
     in the February 2018 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “Seventeen families did not
     receive justice.”

Why$must$an$act$be$voluntary?


      The requirement of a voluntary act is based on the belief that it would be
      fundamentally unfair to punish individuals who do not consciously choose to
      engage in criminal activity and who therefore cannot be considered morally
      blameworthy.

      There also is the practical consideration that there is no need to deter,
      incapacitate, or rehabilitate individuals who involuntarily engage in criminal
      conduct

Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea -- There
can be no crime, large or small, without an
evil mind

  The U.S. Supreme Court noted that the requirement of a “relation between some
  mental element and punishment for a harmful act is almost as instinctive as the child’s
  familiar exculpatory (not responsible) plea, ‘But I didn’t mean to.

  Responsibility. It is just and fair to hold a person accountable who intentionally chooses to
  commit a crime.
  Deterrence. Individuals who act with a criminal intent pose a threat to society and should be
  punished in order to discourage them from violating the law in the future and in order to deter
  others from choosing to violate the law.
  Punishment. The punishment should fit the crime. The severity of criminal punishment should
  depend on whether an individual’s act was intentional, reckless, or accidental.
Common Law MENTAL STATES

General intent: intent to omit the actus reas (intentionally or willfully). There is no
requirement that prosecutors demonstrate that an offender possessed an intent to violate
the law, an awareness that the act is a crime, or an awareness that the act will result in a
particular type of harm. 1) General blameworthy state of mind; 2) generally aware of the
nature of what you are doing; and 3) reckless or negligent as to he existence of the elements
in question. E.g. battery.

Specific intent: mental intent to accomplish a specific result (with the intent to). The
prosecutor is required to demonstrate that the offender possessed the intent to commit
the actus reus and then is required to present additional evidence that the defendant
possessed the specific intent to accomplish a particular result. 1) A further intent beyond
what is required to establish the crime; 2) an intent to achieve a specific result; and 3)A
knowing or purposeful state of mind as to the existence of the elements in question. E.g.
Battery with the intent to kill.

  A man in a crowded elevator begins enthusiastically reenacting a mixed martial arts
  match that he just watch on pay-per-view in his hotel room. He swings his fist left and
  right, reenacting the flurry of blows from the fight. People next to him edge away, but
  eventually he clocks one of them in the face. Is he guilty of battery?

  But what if he hit the guy really hard and is charged with assault with intent to inflict
  serious bodily injury. Is he guilty of that crime?




Quiz

  In Stephen King’s book Misery, an obsessive fan of a mystery writer
  nurses him back to health when he is injured in an automobile accident.
  When he informs her that he intends to leave her house, she smashes
  his legs with a sledge hammer. If she is prosecuted in a common law
  jurisdiction for (1) assault with intent to kill or (2) aggravated assault,
  defined as “assault with a deadly weapon, inflicting great harm,” is she
  guilty of either offense?
     Challenge of Common Law –
     Alvarado v. State

         The defendant was convicted of “intentionally and knowingly” causing serious bodily injury
         to her child by placing him in a tub of hot water




     MPC 2.02. General Requirements
     of Culpability
 [A] person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently . . . with respect
 to each material element of the offense.
 (2) Kinds of Culpability Defined. (a) Purposely. A person acts purposely with respect to material elements of an
 offense when: (i) . . . it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result. . . . (b)
 Knowingly. A person acts knowingly . . . when: (i) If the element involves the nature of his conduct . . . he is aware of
 the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they exist; and (ii) If the element involves a result
 of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result. (c) Recklessly. A
 person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a
 substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of
 such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor’s conduct and the circumstances
 known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would
 observe in the actor’s situation. (d) Negligently. A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an
 offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will
 result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor’s failure to perceive it,
 considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation
 from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor’s situation




Four principle mental states:

1)   Purposely – it was your conscious effort to bring
     about the result
2)   Knowingly - substantially certain that the result
     would occur
3)   Recklessness – you consciously disregarded a
     substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result
     would occur under circumstances that constituted a
     gross deviation from the standard of care that a
     law-abiding person would observe in the situation
4)   Negligently – should have been aware of
     substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result
     would occur under circumstances that constituted a
     gross deviation from the standard of care that a
     law-abiding person would observe in the situation

     Must possess a specific intent or conscious object to commit a

     Two individuals who self-identified as Nazis committed a hate crime
     against victims incorrectly believing they were Jewish. Do they have
     the mens rea to commit the offense? (State v. Costella)




Knowingly



  Aware that circumstances exist or that a result is practically
  certain to follow from his or her conduct
You decide


    John wants to kill Aaron. He makes a bomb to plant in Aaron’s
    house. The bomb is powerful enough to destroy the house and
    all of its occupants. On the day that John plans to activate the
    bomb, he knows that Aaron’s wife, Sarah, is in the house.
    Although Sarah is not the “conscious object” of his behavior and
    he does not want her to die, he is “practically certain” that she
    will die, yet he activates the bomb anyway. What level of mens
    rea describes John’s state of mind toward Aaron?




Purposely v. Knowingly


    Purposefully and knowingly are similar in that the defendant

    acts purposely wants the particular harmful result. The person who
    acts knowingly does not necessarily want or hope for the particular
    result, but is practically certain his actions will cause the result.




Recklessly

Two-fold test for reckless conduct:

1) a conscious disregard of substantial and unjustifiable risk – defendant
must personally be aware of a sever and serious risk. Unjustifiable means
that the harm was not created in an effort to serve a greater good.
2) A gross deviation from the standard that a law-abiding person would
observe in the same situation – defendant must have acted in a fashion
that demonstrated a clear lack of judgment and concern for the
consequences. This must clearly depart from he behavior that would be
expected of other law abiding individuals. (Hranicky v. State)

An unhinged 1st year decides to blow up his hated law professor:

a) He brings a bomb wrapped as a gift to the professor during office hours and sets it down on the desk
asking it not be opened in front of him. However, it’s the student’s most loved law school professor sitting
with his hated professor. He leaves and walks down the hall a safe distance. He hesitates torn between his
desire to kill his hated law professor and the deep regret of losing his loved professor. The he pushes

waiting for office hours to being. He walks down the hall and looks back. He doesn’t think there is enough
explosives in the bomb to harm them even though the door is closed. He says “Nah” and then pushed
button. Contrary to his expectations, he kills the study group. What mens rea?

by a group of twenty boys who thought someone in Sean’s group said something derogatory.
Sean denied it and said they wanted no trouble. They began to leave and walked towards
their car. The defendant saw the group said “those are the guys from the party.” He
approached he group and demanded that Marty give him a beer from his six-pack. He
refused. The defendant attempted to hit Marty but missed and hit Sean in the face with a wine
bottle casing him to fall to the ground, sustain a broken jaw, and break his now. He lost a
tooth and suffered from permanent damage to his lips and jaw. He is charged with
aggravated battery or “a person who, in committing a battery, intentionally or knowing causes
great bodily injury. Does he have the mens rea for that crime?

Transferred intent: individual intends to attack
on person but inadvertently injures another

The classic formulation of the common law
doctrine of transferred intent states that the
defendant’s guilt is “exactly what it would
have been had the blow fallen upon the
intended victim instead of the bystander.”




 Development of the Law


   Saunders gave his wife a poison apple. She took a bite out of the apple and gave the apple to
   her daughter, who died after finishing the apple. Saunders’s intent to kill his wife was
   transferred to his daughter, and the judge convicted him of killing his daughter although his
   intent was to poison his wife. (Regina v. Saunders)

   The doctrine of transferred intent subsequently was adopted by courts in the United States.
   Transferred intent primarily is applied to cases of homicide and battery although it applies to
   other cases as well. Most courts limit the doctrine to crimes requiring an intent of purposely or
   knowingly. (People v. Scott)

   innocent teenager, Jack Gibson, who was sitting in a nearby car. Are they guilty of
   killing Gibson?
 Why?


    Individual accountability. Defendants should be held responsible for the result (murder) that
    they intended to achieve (murder) and did achieve (murder).

    Justice. There is a social interest in punishing defendants whose acts create the social harm
    that they intended to commit despite the fact that the wrong individual was victimized.




MISTAKE
Of law - a defendant will show they didn't have the
mental state to commit a crime due to a
misunderstanding of the law



Of fact – Mistakes of fact arise when a criminal
defendant misunderstood some fact that negates
an element of the crime.




 Mistake of law


   “Ignorance of the law is no excuse.” Why not?

   Knowledge. People are expected to know the law.
   Evidence. Defendants may falsely claim that they were unaware of the law.
   This claim would be difficult for the prosecution to overcome.
   Public Policy. The enforcement of the law ensures social stability.
   Uniformity. Individuals should not be permitted to define for themselves the
   legal rules that govern society.

   A strict liability offense is a crime that does
   not require a mens rea, and an individual
   may be convicted based solely on the
   commission of a criminal act.

   Congress and state legislatures typically
   indicate that these are strict liability laws by
   omitting language such as “knowingly” or
   “purposely” from the text of the law.




  strict liability offenseS -- public
  health and safety laws

Examples are the prohibition of acts such as “selling alcohol to minors” or “driving without
a license” or statutory rape (regulatory or public welfare laws)


These are acts that most people avoid, and individuals who engage in such acts generally
possess a criminal intent.

    Is a bartender guilty for selling alcohol to a minor (strict liability
    offense) if she honestly believes that the minor is an adult and even
    if any reasonable person would have shared that belief?

    What about the manufacturer who sells contaminated drugs (strict
    liability offense) who had no idea that the drugs were
    contaminated and even if she took reasonable steps to assure the
    purity of drugs?
Justification of Strict Liability
Offense
These laws deter unqualified people from participating in potentially
dangerous activities, such as the production and selling of
pharmaceutical drugs, and that those who engage in this type of
activity will take extraordinary steps to ensure that they proceed in a
cautious and safe fashion. There is also concern that requiring
prosecutors to establish a criminal intent in these relatively minor
cases will consume time and energy and divert resources from other
cases.




Steelman v. State




You decide …

 In July 1995, Ronnie Polk was the passenger in an automobile that was stopped for a moving violation in
 close proximity to Highland Christian School in Lafayette, Indiana. A police officer’s search led to the seizure
 of crack cocaine and several tablets of diazepam. In Indiana, possession of more than 3 grams of cocaine
 within 1,000 feet of a school is enhanced from a Class D felony to a Class A felony punishable by 30 years in
 prison, and possession of a Schedule IV drug without a doctor’s prescription within 1,000 feet of a school is
 enhanced from a Class D to a Class C felony, punishable by 4 years in prison.

 Polk was convicted and sentenced for both offenses, and his two sentences were to run concurrently. Polk
 also was convicted of being a habitual offender, and his combined sentence for the three convictions
 totaled 50 years. Polk maintains that the legislature did not intend for the possession of cocaine within 1,000
 feet of a school to be a strict liability offense that applied to passengers possessing narcotics in automobiles
 because this did not advance Indiana’s interest in protecting schoolchildren. Applying the statute to
 individuals in automobiles would allow the police to wait to stop automobiles suspected of containing
 narcotics as they approached within 1,000 feet of a school.

Bad Result
Required




Causation



          There is no criminal liability if the act or
          omission of the accused did not cause the
          resulting harm




Why causation is central to
criminal law?
The requirement of causality is based on two considerations:

Individual Responsibility. The criminal law is based on individual responsibility. Causality
connects a person’s acts to the resulting social harm and permits the imposition of the
appropriate punishment.

Fairness. Causality limits liability to individuals whose conduct produces a prohibited
social harm. A law that declares that all individuals in close proximity to a crime are
liable regardless of their involvement would be unfair and penalize people for being in
the wrong place at the wrong time. If such a law were enacted, individuals might hesitate
to gather in crowds or bars or to attend concerts and sporting events.

Cause
A defendant’s act is the cause in fact
or factual cause of a harm in order for
the defendant to be criminally

fact or factual cause is typically a
straightforward question of whether
“but for” the defendant’s act, the result

2. In another scenario, you shoot but an ambulance driver rescues the victim, the ambulance’s brakes fail, and the vehicle
crashes into a wall, killing the driver and victim. Are you or the driver responsible for the victim’s death?

3. You later learn that the victim died after the staff of the hospital emergency room waited five hours to treat her and that
she would have lived had she received timely assistance. Who is responsible for the death?

a power outage caused by a hurricane? What if the victim was wounded from the gunshot and, although barely conscious,
stumbled into the street and was hit by an automobile or by lightning?
Multiple Causes

An actual cause need not be an exclusive cause but can be a substantial
factor in bringing about the result.

Successive or concurrent acts that contribute to the bad result:
1. Accelerating Causes – An actual cause that occurs after the crime that
accelerates the death
2. Concurrent Sufficient Cause – Multiple independent causes of death
occurring at approximately the same time
3. Concurrent Insufficient Case – Cumulative acts neither of which would
have fully caused the harm results in it




Results must have been foreseeable to a
reasonable person, regardless of the mental
state of the conduct (legal causation)




PEOPLE V. KIBBEE


 To prove the crime of murder, the prosecution must show that the
 defendant’s actions were a sufficiently direct cause of the death. It is not
 necessary for the defendant to have intended to cause a death. Rather,
 the death must have been something that should have been foreseen as
 being reasonably related to the defendant’s actions (foreseeable).
 Chain of Causation

Whether or not the intervening causes “break” the chain of causation
(a sequence of causally related actions) depends on the foreseeability
of the the intervening case (the force or event that causes the harm to
occur in an unexpected way). If the chain is broken, the defendant’s
actions are no longer considered to be responsible for the results after
the break




1. Dependent/Responsive Intervening
Causes
   A responsive/dependent intervening cause will only break the chain
   of causation if it is not just unforeseeable but highly unusual.

   In most instances, the defendant is considered responsible because
   the defendant’s behavior caused the victim to respond. The issue is
   the foreseeability of the victim’s response rather than
   the reasonableness of the victim’s response. A defendant is relieved
   of responsibility only in those instances in which the victim’s reaction
   to the crime is both abnormal and unforeseeable.

 2. Defendant stabbed the victim in the chest with a knife. After police officers responded to an emergency call and located
 the victim, he was transported to a hospital. When the victim arrived at the hospital he was conscious, talking, and able to
 assist in moving himself from the ambulance cot to the emergency room stretcher. However, the victim's condition quickly
 deteriorated and, after unsuccessful emergency surgery was performed, he died. defendant presented evidence establishing
 that there were two physicians who treated the victim in the emergency room. According to an "incident report" prepared by
 one of the doctors, the other surgeon provided sub-standard care to the victim in a variety of ways by failing to recognize the
 possibility of a serious internal injury, failing to undertake procedures necessary to remove accumulated blood from the
 victim's chest, withholding administration of additional fluids and units of blood, calling off the "Trauma Red" alert which had
 been called to summon an anesthesiologist, failing to promptly to initiate a thoracotomy despite the fact the victim was in
 "arrest,“ failing to find the cut of the victim's heart and refusing to approve a resuscitative procedure whereby blood is
 administered directly to the heart. Foreseeable?

2. Independent (or Coincidental)
Intervening Cause

        Coincidental intervening acts arise when a defendant’s act
        places a victim in a particular place where the victim is
        harmed by an unforeseeable event. A defendant is not
        considered legally responsible for a victim’s injury or death
        that results from a coincidental intervening act/independent
        intervening cause.




Examples

1. A mugger victim flees after the crime to a park. He dies from injuries
sustained when a tree that has been struck by lightning falls on him.

Apparent safety doctrine



  The "apparent safety" doctrine says
  that once the danger from the
  defendant is no longer present, the
  Court no longer considers that
  defendant a proximate cause.
People v. Rideout



 A superseding intervening cause does not need to be the only cause of a
 victim's injury to break the chain of causation such that the defendant's
 conduct is not the proximate cause of the injury.




MPC


 The Model Penal Code states:

 “Conduct is the cause of a result when…(a) it is an antecedent but for which the
 result in question would not have occurred” (Model Penal Code § 2.03(1)(a)).

 The actual result cannot be “too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a
 [just] bearing on the actor’s liability” (Model Penal Code § 2.03 (2) (b)).




Put it together …



  1. Henry and Mary get into an argument over their child custody
  agreement in front of their apartment complex. Henry gives Mary a
  hard shove. Mary staggers backward, is struck by lightning, and
  dies instantly.
Put it together …

    2. Henry and Mary get into the same argument over their child
  custody agreement, but this time they are in their garage, which is
crowded with furniture. Henry gives Mary a hard shove, even though
 she is standing directly in front of a large entertainment center filled
 with books and a heavy thirty-two-inch television set. Mary staggers
backward into the entertainment center and it crashes down on top of
                             her, killing her.

Mary out of the garage. Mary escapes Henry and hides in an

in the shed, he kills her and steals her money and jewelry.

                STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION
RULE OF LEGALITY




  An individual may not be criminally punished for an act
  that was not clearly condemned in a statute prior to the
  time the individual committed he act.

  This is reflected in two constitutional principles:

  1) Prohibition on ex post facto laws

  2) Requirement of statutory clarity




 “Subjecting of men to
 punishments for thigs which, when
 they were done were beaches of
 no law, and the practice of
 arbitrary imprisonments, have
 been, in all ages, the favorite and
 most formidable instrument of
 tyranny”
             – Alexander Hamilton




 1. Ex Post Facto Laws

 The prohibition on ex post facto laws prevents legislation being applied to acts
 committed before the statute went into effect. The legislature is free to declare that
 in the future a previously innocent act will be a crime.

 Four categories of ex post facto laws:
 1. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law and which
 was innocent when done, criminal and punishes such action
 2. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was when
 committed
 3. Every law that changes the punishment and inflicts a greater punishment than
 the law annexed to the crime, when committed
 4. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence and receives less or different
 testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense in
 order to convict the offender
 Rationale for Ex Post Facto
 Prohibition


      The constitutional rule against ex post facto laws is based on the familiar
      interests in providing individuals notice of criminal conduct and protecting
      individuals against retroactive “after the fact” statutes.




 Stogner v. Calfornia



   A law enacted after expiration of a previously applicable limitations period
   violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution when it is applied to
   revive a previously time-barred prosecution.




 2. Statutory Clarity and Void for
 Vagueness
The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the
US Constitution prohibit depriving individuals
of “life, liberty or property without due
process of law.” Due process requires that
criminal statutes should be drafted in a clear
and understandable fashion.

A statue that fails to meet this standard is
unconstitutional on the grounds that is is void
for vagueness.
 Rationale for Vagueness
 Requirement

Due process requires that individuals receive notice of criminal conduct --
Statutes are required to define criminal offenses with sufficient clarity so that
ordinary individuals are able to understand what conduct is prohibited.

Due process requires that the police, prosecutors, judges, and jurors are
provided with a reasonably clear statement of prohibited behavior. The
requirement of definite standards ensures the uniform and nondiscriminatory
enforcement of the law.




 Papachristou v. City of
 Jacksonville

    The U.S. Supreme Court expressed the concern that a broadly worded vagrancy
    statute punishing “rogues and vagabonds”; “lewd, wanton and lascivious
    persons”; “common railers and brawlers”; and “habitual loafers” failed to provide
    standards for law enforcement and risked that the poor, minority groups, and
    nonconformists would be targeted for arrest based on the belief that they posed a
    threat to public safety




 Are these vague?


    1. Statute punishing individuals for “known to be a member of any gang consisting of
    two or more persons” held void for vagueness (Grayned v. Rockford)
    2. Ordinance making in criminal for “three or more persons to assemble … on any of
    the sidewalks … and there conduct themselves in a manner annoying to persons
    passing by” as void for vagueness (Coates v. Cincinnati)
    3. Punishing ”Crime against nature” as for raping 10 year old (Horn v. State)
    4. A statute that required that an individual detained for investigation by a police officer
    present “credible and reliable” identification that carries a “reasonable assurance” of
    its authenticity and that provides “means for later getting in touch with the person who
    has identified himself.
RULE OF LENITY


   Requires the courts to construe a penal statute as favorably to the
   defendant as its language and the circumstances of its application
   may reasonably permit

Bobby was pulled over for speeding. When the officer stepped up to
her window he noticed an open gas can on the floor of her car. The
officer issued Bobby two tickets, one for speeding, and another for the
unsafe handling of explosives. Bobby did not know that the gas can in
the back of the car did not have the cap on. The relevant statute states
“it is a criminal action to knowingly transport highly flammable or toxic
materials in an unsafe manner.” Bobby wants to rely on the lenity

(1) A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, or
both.
(2) A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when:
        (a) acting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he causes an innocent or irresponsible person to
        engage in such conduct; or
        (b) he is made accountable for the conduct of such other person by the Code or by the law defining the offense; or
        (c) he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the offense.
(3) A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:
        (a) with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he
               (i) solicits such other person to commit it; or
               (ii) aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it; or having a legal duty to prevent the
               commission of the offense, fails to make proper effort so to do; or
        (b) his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity.
(4) When causing a particular result is an element of an offense, an accomplice in the conduct causing such result is an accomplice in the
commission of that offense, if he acts with the kind of culpability, if any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission of the
offense….
(7) An accomplice may be convicted on proof of the commission of the offense and of his complicity therein, though the person claimed to have
committed the offense has not been prosecuted or convicted or has been convicted of a different offense or degree of offense or has an immunity
to prosecution or conviction or has been acquitted

 harbors or conceals the other; or provides or aids in providing a weapon,
transportation, disguise or other means of avoiding apprehension or
effecting escape; or conceals or destroys evidence of the crime, or

  Does the mere presence rule alleviate Phoebe of criminal liability?
 Accomplice intent?

The Model Penal Code follows this approach and requires the accomplice to act “with the purpose of promoting
or facilitating the commission of the offense” (Model Penal Code § 2.06(3) (a)).

In many jurisdictions, the accomplice must act with specific intent or purposely when aiding or assisting the
principal (Or. Rev. Stat., 2010). Specific intent or purposely means the accomplice desires the principal to
commit the crime.

In other jurisdictions, if the crime is serious and the accomplice acts with general intent or knowingly or
has awareness that the principal will commit the crime with his or her assistance, intent to further the crime’s
commission could be inferred (People v. Lauria, 2010).

In a minority of jurisdictions, only general intent or acting knowingly that the crime will be promoted or
facilitated is required, regardless of the crime’s seriousness (Washington Rev. Code Ann., 2010).

        Assume that after José burglarizes, beats, and rapes Maria, local police
        arrest José and Abel. The police transport José and Abel to the police
        station and take them to separate rooms for interrogation. The police
        officer who interrogates José is a rookie and forgets to read José his
        Miranda rights. Thereafter, the police contact Maria, but she refuses to
        cooperate with the investigation because she fears reprisal from José. The
        district attorney decides not to prosecute José because of the tainted
        interrogation. In this case, Abel could still be prosecuted for battery and
        possibly rape and burglary as an accomplice in some jurisdictions. Can
        Abel still be liable as an accomplice?

ACCESSORY INTENT


   The criminal intent element required for an accessory has two parts.
   First, the defendant must act with general

   Second, the defendant must help or assist the principal escape or
   evade arrest or prosecution for and conviction of the offense

        Looking at the prior incident between Jim and his father, did
        Jim have the necessary intent to be an accessory?
Is this fair?


The law presumes that an individual who
assists a criminal consented to be bound
by the conduct of the principal in the first
degree. Under a notion of derivative
liability, the accessory’s guilt flow form
the acts of the primary perpetrator of the
crime

How can it be liable?


The acts of an employee “may be controlled in the interests of public policy, by imputing his
act to his employer and imposing penalties upon the corporation for which he is acting”

1. Respondent Superior – a corporation may be held liable for the conduct of an employee
who commits a crime within the scope of his or her employment who possess the intent to
benefit the corporation

2. MPC 2.07 – criminal liability is imposed in those instances that the criminal conduct is
authorized, requested, commanded, performed, or reckless tolerated by the board of
directors or by a high mangerial official acting on behalf of the corporation within the scope
of his or her office or employment

US v. Kmart

In 1998, Kmart employees in Puerto Rico devised a scheme to defraud insurance
companies to obtain money and property by submitting false Hurricane Georges
related insurance claims. Reports indicate that a regional vice president of Kmart
and others instructed store managers and employees of Kmart in Puerto Rico to
intentionally wet merchandise that was not damaged by Hurricane Georges for
the purpose of including hem in Kmart's hurricane loss claim. Managers with
support of Regional Directors sent false documents to Kmart's headquarters in
Michigan through Federal Express. Should Kmart be held liable? Note that a
felony charge would significantly impact ability to sell alcohol and firearms.
Is it contrary to American
Jurisprudence?

  The primary reason for this departure from individual responsibility in the
  case of corporations is to encourage employers to control and to monitor
  employees so as to ensure that the public is protected from potential
  dangers

Social Host Laws


    Social host liability laws hold adults liable for providing liquor in their
    home to minors in the event that an accident or injury occurs. Variants
    are so-called teen party ordinances, which declare that it is criminal for
    an adult to host a party for minors at which alcohol is served.
Williams v. Garcetti


 Upheld the constitutionality of a California parental responsibility
 statute that sated that :a parent or legal guardian to any person under
 the age of 18 years shall have the duty to exercise reasonable care
 supervision, protection, and control over their minor child … a parent or
 guardian who “act or omission causes or encourages a child to violate
 a curfew, be habitually truant or commit a crime is held liable under
 the statute if they know or should have known that their child is at risk
 of delinquency and they are able to control the child.

The City of Trenton, New Jersey, adopted a “parent responsibility
ordinance.” The ordinance presumed that a parent is responsible for the
misbehavior of a child who twice within one year is adjudged guilty of
acts defined as violations of the public peace. The acts so defined
include adjudications for delinquency and of the status of being a
juvenile in need of supervision. A parent convicted under the ordinance
may be fined up to $500. Should parents be held responsible for the
“misbehavior of a child”?

                  The Insanity Defense




Insanity Defense


    The insanity defense, also known as the mental disorder
    defense, is an excuse in a criminal case, arguing that the
    defendant is not responsible for their actions due to an
    episodic psychiatric disease at the time of the criminal act.




Insane Criminals
Why aLLOW an insanity defense?

 Free Will. The defendant did not make a deliberate decision to violate
 the law. The defendant’s criminal act resulted from a disability.
 Theories of Punishment. Defendants who are unable to distinguish right
 from wrong or to control their conduct cannot be deterred by criminal
 punishment, and it would be cruel to seek retribution for acts that result
 from a disability.
 Humanitarianism. An individual found not guilty by reason of insanity
 may pose a continuing danger to society. This individual is best
 incapacitated and treated by doctors in a noncriminal rather than in a
 criminal environment.

   2) Irresistible Impulse (17 states)

   3) Durham (New Hampshire)

   4) ALI Substantial Capacity Test (18 states)

   Fundamental difference among these tests is
   whether the emphasis is placed on a
   defendant’s ability to know right from wrong or
   on a defendant’s ability to control his or her
   behavior
1. M’Naghten Test


      At the time of committing the act, the party accused must have
      been suffering from a defect of reason, or from a disease of the
      mind, as a result of which the defendant ”did not know what he
      was doing” (did not know the “nature and quality of his or her
      act”), or the defendant “did not know he was doing wrong”




Elements of the M’Naghten Test


1) The “mental disease or defect” requirement is satisfied by any organic
(physical) damage, psychological disorder, or intellectual deficiency
(e.g., a low IQ or feeblemindedness) that

2) results in individuals’ not knowing what they were doing; or

3) results in individuals’ not knowing they were doing wrong.

  The defendant Rodney Crenshaw was honeymooning with his wife
  in Canada and suspected that she was unfaithful. Crenshaw beat
  his wife senseless, stabbed her 24 times, and then decapitated the
  body with an axe. He then drove to a remote area and disposed of
  his wife’s body and cleaned the hotel room. Crenshaw claimed to
  be a member of the Muscovite religious faith, a religion that
  required a man to kill a wife guilty of adultery.
  He claimed he believed that his act, although illegal, was morally
  justified. Does he satisfy M’Naughten? (State v. Crenshaw)

 are dead. The operator dispatches an emergency call to law enforcement.

 that she killed her children so that they could leave this earth and enter
 heaven. Andrea thereafter claims she is not guilty for killing her children by
 reason of insanity. Successful?

2. Irresistible impulse Test



  The irresistible impulse test is used to determine whether, as a result of
  a mental disease or defect, a defendant was unable to control or resist
  his or her own impulses, thus leading to a criminal act. If so, the
  defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity
  Requirements

  At the time of the crime:
  (1) was the defendant afflicted with a disease of the mind?
  (2) If so, did the defendant know right from wrong with respect to the act
  charged?
             (a) If not, the law excuses the defendant.
             (b) If the defendant did have such knowledge, the law will still
  excuse the defendant if two conditions occur:
             A. If the mental disease caused the defendant to so far lose the
  power to chose between right and wrong and to avoid doing the alleged
  act that the disease destroyed the defendant’s free will, and
             B. if the mental disease was the sole cause of the act.




  v. M’Naghten



     The irresistible impulse insanity defense generally supplements M’Naghten, so
     the focus is on the defendant’s awareness (cognitive) and the defendant’s will
     (ability to control conduct).

and scissors in her backpack. Her plan is to subdue each sister with the stun gun and then
hack off her hair. As she arrives at the house, she sees Agnes, one of her sorority sisters,
trip and fall in the parking lot, ripping her cashmere sweater and scraping her chin. Feeling
a stab of pity, Jolene ignores Agnes and walks hurriedly toward the building. As she
enters, Ashley, another sorority sister, turns, scowls at Jolene, and barks, “What in the
world are you wearing? You look like you just rolled out of bed!” Jolene pulls the stun
gun out of her backpack and shoots Ashley. While Ashley is lying on the floor, Jolene
takes out the scissors and cuts Ashley’s hair off at the scalp. Jolene claims she is not guilty
for assault and battery of Ashley by reason of insanity.

Lucky bets on the horses. Lucky bets on the dogs. Lucky bets on football games. Lucky bets on
everything — and usually loses! Lucky is a compulsive gambler, unable to stop his excessive and
destructive betting. In fact, he has been diagnosed with “pathological gambling disorder,” a disorder
of impulse control recognized in 1980 by the mental health professions in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. These
individuals have an overwhelming urge to gamble, and their compulsive gambling disrupts their
family and work life. They always think the next bet is the “grand slam” that will finally put them
ahead. Lucky knows. He owes his bookie so much that he secretly embezzled money from his job to
place the grand slam bet. When he lost again, he wore a mask and robbed a bank to get money for
his next bet. Arrested shortly thereafter, Lucky is charged with gambling, embezzling, and armed
robbery. Can he plead insanity in a M’Naughten state? What about irresistible impulse state?
 3. Durham Product Test


    The defense has two elements.

    First, the defendant must have a mental disease or defect.

    The second element has to do with causation. If the criminal conduct is
    “caused” by the mental disease or defect, then the conduct should be
    excused under the circumstances.




 elements


    The Durham Rule holds that if a criminal defendant’s “mental
    disease or defect” was the reason that he or she committed a
    crime, the defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity.

    This test is currently used only in New Hampshire, since it has
    been deemed too broad by other states and jurisdictions

Arianna has been diagnosed with paranoia. Most psychiatric experts agree that
individuals afflicted with paranoia unreasonably believe that the human population is
“out to get them.” Arianna works under the direct supervision of Nora, who has a
physical condition called “walleye.” Nora’s walleye makes it appear that she is looking to
the side when she addresses people. Arianna gradually becomes convinced that Nora is
communicating secret messages to their coworkers when she is speaking to Arianna.
Arianna is genuinely frightened that Nora is telling their coworkers to kill her, and she
decides she needs to defend herself. Arianna brings a gun to work one day, and when
Nora begins talking to her about her tendency to take overlong lunches, Arianna pulls the
gun out of her cubicle and shoots and kills Nora. Arianna claims she is not guilty for
killing Nora by reason of insanity. Agree?

4. The Substantial Capacity Test


 MPC 4.01(1)(2) provides that :

 of such conduct as a result of mental disease of defect he lacks
 substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his
 conduct or to confirm his conduct to the requirements of law…

 The Term “mental disease or defect” do not include an
 abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise
 antisocial conduct.




V. M’Naghten and Irresistible
impulse test
 Compared to M'Naghten, it lowered the insanity standard from an
 absolute knowledge of right from wrong to a substantial incapacity
 to appreciate the difference between right and wrong; thereby
 recognizing degrees of incapacity.

 ALI also broadened the insanity test to include a volitional or
 "irresistible impulse" component. The test focused on the
 "defendant's understanding of his conduct" and also on the
 "defendant's ability to control his actions."

Criticisms of Insanity Defense

1. Bias – wealthy defendants able to hire experts of indigent
2. Theories of punishment – undermines criminal justice concern with
deterrence, retribution, and incapacitation of guilty defendants
3. Moral Blameworthiness – Fine line between legally sane and insane
but legally insane avoid imprisonment
4. Experts – insanity defense typically involves a battle of experts who
rely on technical language that is difficult for jurors to understand.

                                    INTOXICATION




Intoxication is a defense available to criminal
defendants on the basis that, because of the
intoxication, the defendant did not understand the
nature of his or her actions or know what he or she was
doing.

The intoxication defense applies in very limited
circumstances and typically depends on whether the
intoxication was voluntary or involuntary and what level
of intent is required by the criminal charge.




 Voluntary Intoxication

   Under prevailing legal standards, voluntary intoxication is an applicable
   defense only for certain crimes, and, even in those circumstances, juries are far
   less likely to accept a defense of intoxication when the defendant brought the
   intoxication upon himself or herself.

   The abolition of the intoxication defense in addition to deterring excessive
   drinking is based on the danger that intoxicated individuals present to the
   public.

   There also is the risk that an intoxicated individual who is not held fully
   accountable may continue to drink to excess and pose a threat to society in
   the future.
Involuntary Intoxication

 Involuntary Intoxication is a defense to any and all criminal
 offenses in those states where the defendant’s state of mind
 satisfies the standard for the insanity defense in the state

 Requirements:
 1) intoxication must have been involuntary
 2) intoxication caused by the intoxicating substance in question and
 not some other intoxicant
 3) due to the involuntary intoxication, defendant was temporarily
 insane (defense in that state)




MEANS OF Involuntary Intoxication

Involuntary intoxication can occur in any of four ways:

1. Duress – An individual is coerced into consuming an intoxicant

2. Mistake – An individual mistakenly consumes a narcotic rather than his or her
prescribed medicine

3. Fraud – An individual consumes a narcotic as a result of a fraudulent
misrepresentation of the nature of the substance

4. Medication – An individual has an extreme and unanticipated reaction to
medication prescribed by a doctor

1. NECESSITY
  The necessity defense recognizes that conduct
  that would otherwise be criminal is justified
  when undertaken to prevent a significant harm.

  Under the Model Penal Code, “[c]onduct which
  the actor believes to be necessary to avoid
  harm or evil…is justifiable, provided that: (a) the
  harm or evil sought to be avoided by such
  conduct is greater than that sought to be
  prevented by the law defining the offense
  charged” (Model Penal Code § 3.02(1)(a)).
Regina v. Dudley and Stephens
revisited …

     The English court rejected the defense of necessity and the proposition
     that the members of the crew were justified in taking the life of Parker in
     order to survive.

     Lord Coleridge asked, “By what measure is the comparative value of lives
     to be measured? Is it to be strength, or intellect, or what? … It is … our duty to
     declare that the prisoners’ act in this case was willful murder…. [T]he facts …
     are no legal justification of the homicide….”




Elements of defense:

  1. There was an immediate and imminent harm.
  2. The defendant also must not have been substantially at fault in
  creating the emergency.
  3. The harm created by the criminal act is less than that caused by
  the harm confronting the individuals.
  4. An individual reasonably expected a direct causal relationship
  between his acts and the harm to be averted.
  5. There were no available legal alternatives to violating the law.
  6. The criminal statute that was violated does not preclude the
  necessity defense.

  Tamara gets lost while hiking in a remote, mountainous
  area. After wandering around for hours with the
  temperature dropping, Tamara finds a locked cabin.
  Tamara breaks a window and climbs inside. Once inside,
  Tamara prepares some canned chili, drinks tap water, and
  uses the telephone to call law enforcement.
Still Necessity?



    Change the facts in the preceding example,
    and imagine that Tamara steals money and
    jewelry in addition to the chili and tap
    water.




Still still Necessity?



    Change the facts in the preceding example, and imagine that
    Tamara kills the cabin’s owner because he refuses to allow
    her to enter.




Still still still Necessity?



    Change the facts in the preceding example, and imagine that
    Tamara went on the hike ignoring a sign at the park entrance
    that prohibits all hiking in the area due to safety risks
    associated with low temperatures and lack of marked trails
    and signage. Is a defense of necessity still available to her?
Reasons for it



  Respect. Punishing individuals under these circumstances would lead
  to disrespect for the legal system.

  Equity. Necessity is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and introduces
  flexibility and fairness into the legal system.
  .




Criticisms of it


     Self-Help. Individuals should obey the law and should not be
     encouraged to violate legal rules.

     Mistakes. Society suffers when an individual makes the wrong
     choice in the “choice of evils.”

     Politicalization of the Law. The defense has been invoked by
     antiabortion and antinuclear activists and individuals who have
     broken the law in the name of various political causes.




However …
                            What is the standard?




                       The belief in the imminent,
                       actual, and greater threat must
                       be reasonable to the average
                       individual, not only the

You decide

On July 26, 1997, Bell, a convicted felon, was playing cards with five others at his home.
They heard gunshots, went outside, and saw Bell’s neighbor, Anthony Brooks, running
toward them. Brooks was being pursued by a man firing a pistol in the direction of Bell’s
house. When Brooks reached Bell’s house, he stated that “a couple of dudes had jumped
on him,” which prompted Bell and the other card players to accompany Brooks outside,
though all were unarmed. Outside, the group was fired upon by a number of assailants.
When one of the assailants stopped to reload a shotgun, Bell managed to take the shotgun
away from her, and Bell’s brother took a shotgun away from a different assailant. After the
melee, Bell gave one of the two shotguns to the police, but kept the other. Later that
evening, the assailants returned, “shooting and getting out of their cars and making threats.”
In the days following the attack, Bell “felt that [the assailants] could come back at any time,”
and his state of mind was “one of fear.” Four days later, during a search by police of Bell’s
apartment pursuant to a warrant, Bell handed over the second shotgun. Was the defendant
entitled to the defense of necessity to being a felon in possession of a firearm?

                                       DURESS
Rationale

  Realism. The law cannot expect people to act in a heroic
  fashion and resist threats of death or serious bodily harm.

  Criminal Intent. An individual who commits a crime in
  response to a severe threat lacks a criminal intent.

  Criminal Act. Individuals who commit crimes under duress act
  in an involuntary rather than voluntary fashion.




Elements


       1. A reasonable fear of imminent death or serious bodily
       harm
       2. Through the words or actions of another person
       3. With no reasonable opportunity to escape the threat
       4. Through no fault of the defendant

     drawer after he points a loaded gun at her head. Duress?




Still STILL Duress?



     Change the example with Keisha and Brian, and imagine that
     Brian’s threat is made in a phone call, rather than in person. Brian
     threatens to kill Keisha if she doesn’t place thousands of dollars in
     an envelope and mail it to him at a specified address. If Keisha
     does this, can she claim duress?




Still Duress?

   Change the preceding example with Keisha and Brian, and
   imagine that Keisha borrowed a large sum money from
   crime boss Brian who is notoriously violent to invest in an
   illegal fraud scheme. The scheme is a bust and she loses all
   the money so he orders her to steal money form the bank to
   pay him back or else he will kill her. He drives her to the
   bank and she takes the money out of one of the cashier
   drawers. Can she claim duress?
Still Still Duress?



       Change the preceding example with Keisha and Brian,
       and imagine that Brian orders Keisha to kill his ex-wife Pat,
       who works at the station next to Keisha. Brian thereafter
       hands Keisha a switchblade. If she does so, duress?

trial, he claims that cartel thugs arrived at his house that night and
threated to kill his family if he did not transport the drugs to Los Angeles.
In a trial surprise, his sister from Mexico flew to the United States to testify

Necessity v. duress


   The main difference is that duress means that the defendant
   committed a crime because someone directly forced them to do
   it. Necessity involves a choice between two bad alternatives that
   could not be avoided, which arose from the circumstances rather
   than the actions of a specific person.

                            SELF-DEFENSE




According to self-defense, a person may
use a reasonable amount of fore, even
deadly force, to protect himself or herself
Reasons for Self-Defense
Defense
   Utilitarian – failure to recognize self-defense would be pointless as
   punishment is unlikely to deter an actor who believes he must act or
   die now. Plus, defendant slayer did the right thing and aggressor
   asked for response
   Retributivists – innocent victims of aggressive attacks are not
   immoral actors and not blameworthy. Defendant has a right to
   autonomy and not have to surrender




MPC



   The Model Penal Code defines self-defense in § 3.04(1) as “justifiable
   when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary for the
   purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such
   other person on the present occasion.”




Elements of Self-Defense



                 1. Reasonable fear
                 2. An imminent attack, and
                 3. A proportionate amount of force and
                 4. Defendant was not provoke the response
1. Reasonable fear

 An individual who relies on self-defense must act with a reasonable
 belief in the imminence of serious bodily harm or death.

 E.g. The Utah statute on self-defense (Utah Code Ann. § 76-2-402)
 specifies that a person is justified in threatening or using force against
 another in those instances in which the person “reasonably believes that
 force is necessary… to prevent death or serious bodily injury.”




Reasonable belief?

Justin, who weighs over two hundred pounds and is six feet tall, accidentally bumps
into Wanda, a slender ten-year-old child. Wanda spins around and shakes her fist at
Justin. Justin responds by shoving Wanda so hard that she crashes into a telephone
pole and is killed. Self-defense?




People v. Goetz (1986)



Reasonableness to be determined based upon the circumstances facing
defendant an not his own thinking – rather, what the circumstances
dictate to a reasonable person
Test for Reasonableness

     Objective. Defendants must demonstrate that a reasonable
     person under the same circumstances would have believed that
     they confronted an imminent attack (reasonable man standard)

     Subjective. Defendants must demonstrate an honest belief that
     they confronted an imminent attack. (imperfect self-defense)

     Absent a reasonableness requirement, it is feared that individuals
     might act on the basis of suspicion or prejudice or intentionally
     kill or maim and then later claim self-defense.




However …
                           What if mistaken in their
                            unreasonable belief?



                           If the defendant honestly
                           but unreasonably believes self-
                           defense is necessary under the
                           circumstances, a claim
                           of imperfect self-defense may
                           reduce the severity of the
                           offense




Reasonable belief?

Imagine that a slender, female ten-year-old severely abused Justin when he was
younger. Since the abusive incident, Justin has an unreasonable fear of female
children and honestly believes that they can and will hurt him if provoked. If the
trier of fact determines that Justin honestly but unreasonably believed that Wanda
was about to inflict serious bodily injury or kill him, are his actions self-defense
2. Imminent harm

  The threat faced must have been imminent such that it put the criminal
  defendant, or the one he or she was defending, in fear of immediate harm.

   This can be accomplished through words that imply a threat of force or an
   actual show of force. However, mere offensive language is not enough to
   support a claim for self-defense.

   Additionally, the defense is available only while the threat is ongoing. After the
   threat has ended, the use of force is no longer appropriate. This would be
   considered an act of retaliation, as opposed to self-defense.




Imminent harm?

A 19-year-old defendant stabbed a violent cellmate who threatened to
make Schroeder his “sex slave” or “punk.” Schroeder testified that he felt
vulnerable and afraid and woke up at 1:00 a.m. and stabbed his cellmate
in the back with a table knife and hit him in the face with a metal ashtray.
Imminent harm?

A cab driver shot and killed individual who, along with other gang
members, was involved in beating up an elderly man. The assailants
threw a brick at the cab in retaliation for the driver’s yelling at the gang
and allegedly started to move toward the taxi. Imminent harm?




State v. Marshall




     Did the defendant confront an imminent attack?
Why “about to happen”?

Resolution of Disputes. The law encourages the peaceful resolution of
disputes where possible.

Last Resort. Individuals should resort to self-help only when strictly
required.

Evidence. The existence of a clear and measurable threat provides
confidence that the defendant is acting out of self-defense rather than out
of a desire to punish the assailant or to seek revenge. Also, the existence
of a clear threat assists in determining whether there is proportionality
between the threatened harm and defensive response.

  Margot and Maurice get into an argument. Margot throws a book at
  Maurice’s head. Maurice lifts his fist as he approaches Margot.
  Thinking that she is certain to be punched if she does not act,
  Margot punches first. Would Margot be able to assert self-defense?
  What about Maurcice?




3. Proportionate force

Individuals acting in self-defense are entitled to use the force reasonably
believed to be necessary to defend themselves.

Deadly force is force that a reasonable person under the circumstances
would be aware will cause or create a substantial risk of death or
substantial bodily harm. This may be employed to protect against death or
serious bodily harm.

In general, deadly force can by employed in self-defense when a
reasonable person feels threatened with imminent death, serious bodily
injury, and, in some jurisdictions, a serious felony (Or. Rev. Stat. 2010).
Appropriate deadly force?



  Nicholas, an intruder, pins Wanda to the floor of her garage and

  floor with her hand and finds a screwdriver. She plunges the
  screwdriver into Nicholas’s neck, killing him.

                      Under the duty to retreat, many
                      states require that a defendant
                      make an attempt to avoid the
                      use of deadly force by leaving a
                      threatening situation if possible.
                      In these states, only after an
                      attempt to retreat from the
                      violent situation may a
                      defendant use deadly force.
Quiz

   Sandy and Sue have an argument in the park. Sue pulls a
   knife out of a sheath that is strapped to her leg and
   begins to advance toward Sandy. Sandy also has a knife
   in her pocket.




However …
                   That may no apply if there
                    is a “stand your ground”
                      law (Castle Doctrine)




                  Stand your ground laws provide
                  that when an individual is
                  attacked in his or her home,
                  there is no duty to retreat, and
                  reasonable force can be used.
Rationale for Stand Your Ground
Laws

   1. the promotion of a courageous attitude
   2. the refusal to protect a wrongdoer initiating an attack,
   3. the reluctance of courts to complicate their task by being placed
   in the position of having to rule on various issues surrounding the
   duty to retreat, and
   4. the likelihood that the retreat rule may endanger individuals who
   are required to retreat and encourage wrongdoers who have no
   reason to fear for their lives.




4. Provocation

 Even if an individual is in reasonable fear of imminent attack and uses
 proportionate amount of fore to defend himself, he may not be
 successful claiming self-defense if he was the aggressor in the
 altercation
 US v Petersen, 483 F.2d 122

 This rule has two exceptions. The defendant can be the initial
 aggressor and still raise a self-defense claim if the attacked individual
 responds with excessive force under the circumstances, or if the
 defendant withdraws from the attack and the attacked individual
 persists




Excessive force by victim?


   Patty and Paige get into an argument over a loan Patty made to Paige. Paige
   calls Patty a spoiled brat who always gets her way. Patty slaps Paige across
   the face. Paige grabs a carving knife from the kitchen counter and tries to stab
   Patty. Patty wrestles the knife away and stabs Paige in the chest, killing her.
Withdrawal?

  Imagine that after Patty slaps Paige across the face, Paige begins pounding
  Patty with her fists. Patty manages to escape and runs into the garage. She
  huddles against the garage wall. Paige chases Patty into the garage. Patty says,
  “Please, please don’t hurt me. I’m sorry I slapped you.” Paige kicks Patty in
  the back. Patty turns around and karate chops Paige in the neck, rendering her
  unconscious. Would she be able to successfully claim self-defense?

  What if, in response to the kick in the back, Patty grabbed a speargun in the
  garage and shot her with it?




                                  04
                      Defense of Others
 The permits an individual to lawfully use
 force in defense of another person




Test

       Under the common law, the defendant could not use force legally if the individual
       defended could not use force legally in self-defense. (alter ego rule)

       However, the majority of states now allow a defendant to use force to defend another
       person if it reasonably appears that use of force is justified under the circumstances
       (Commonwealth v. Miranda, 2010).

       The Model Penal Code allows the defense of another when “under the circumstances
       as the actor believes them to be, the person whom he seeks to protect would be
       justified in using such protective force” (Model Penal Code § 3.05(1) (b)). Thus if
       the defendant has a subjective belief that the individual defended could use force
       legally in self-defense, defense of others is appropriate under the Model Penal Code.




Examples

 Alex and Shane, aspiring law enforcement officers, are performing a
 training maneuver in a rural area. Their instructor Devin is watching
 nearby. Alex pretends to attack Shane. Just as Devin is about to
 demonstrate a takedown, Timmy, who is jogging in the area, dashes over
 and begins beating Alex. Is defense of others available to Timmy?
State v. Fair



 Is a person justified in the use of reasonable force when he or she reasonably
 believes that such force is necessary to defend himself or herself or a third
 person from any imminent use of unlawful force?
